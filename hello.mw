The following is a classic _Hello World!_ program for presentation of _MWEB(prototype)_.

The grammar of _MWEB(prototype)_ is straightforwart, the basic elements you should deal with are only code chunks,
each code chunk has a name and a type.  "hello world" is a code chunk with type "C module with Basic I/O".
@[hello world@:C Module with Basic I/O@]
int main()
{
	printf("Hello World!\n");
}
@

"hello world program" describes an executable program, _CFLAGS_ used in compiling, source files involved,
the final executable file's name, etc.
@[hello world program@:C Program@]
CFLAGS="-g"
IN="@[hello world@:C Source@]"
OUT="hello"

"tangle" is a term of _Literate Programming_, means turning a description of program to something machine accept.
_MWEB(prototype)_ is unlike other _Literate Programming_ tools, this process is written entirely by users
using _MIT Scheme_ code.
@[tangle@]
@{user space@}
(tangle-as "hello world program" "Executable")
