Some functionality like searching files going to be included, although important,
I do not implement them in kernel of _MWEB(prototype)_, for the sake of understandability
of source code.

These stuffs concerning about user experience can be separated to a wrapper, like the one here.

The major function of this wrapper is building a tuned environment for _MWEB(prototype)_'s execution.
@[wrapper of mweb-proto@]
#!/bin/sh

@{handle arguments@}
@{build environment@}

echo "(mweb \"$file\" \"$exec\")" | mit-scheme --no-init-file --load ~/.scheme-lib/mweb-proto.scm 
@

@[handle arguments@]
if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
	echo "usage: $0 file exec [include-directory]..."
	exit 1
fi

file=$1
exec=$2
shift; shift

include="$@"

if [ -d ".mweb-lib" ]; then
	include="$HOME/.mweb-lib $include"
fi
@

@[build environment@]
rm -rf mweb-workspace
mkdir mweb-workspace
for d in $include; do
	cp $d/* -t mweb-workspace
done
cp "$file" mweb-workspace
cd mweb-workspace
